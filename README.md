## TL;DR
1. Canadian College Baseball has no one stop shop to view performance
2. Use BeautifulSoup To Scrape Data
3. Decompose Data and insert into a PostgreSQL database similar to the Lahman Set
4. The relationship between run differential and winning percentage was substantially similar to MLB

## Introduction
The Canadian College Baseball Conference is one of three independent collegiate baseball conferences. Starting in 2002, the conference has been a player and community-funded athletic endeavour that has offered the only opportunity for collegiate baseball players in Canada. While not primarily known outside of British Columbia and Alberta (the two provinces that host teams), the conference has hosted many of the top Canadian Baseball players to come out of Canada. While many talented athletes have played in this conference, the goal for many athletes is to move on to an American conference (NCAA or NAIA). Alongside the culture and level of competition, players playing baseball in the US are more likely to sign professional contracts into Major League Baseball (MLB). A considerable barrier to entry is the visibility of players in Canada. Before the internet, travelling to Canada to scout any of these players was economically unfeasible. Therefore, many Canadians wound up stuck in the country. Opportunities have been improving exponentially since the internet. As digital scouting has changed the high school recruiting landscape, more Canadians are getting opportunities in the NCAA. However, these opportunities are still generally only accessible to high school athletes at the top-tier academies. Trevor Brigden is a top prospect of MLB’s best team, the Tampa Bay Rays. Brigden was drafted in the 17th round by Okanagan College (BC) after videos of him playing went viral on Twitter. Better visibility into the statistics would help grow the game in the country and improve the player’s odds of getting drafted by MLB teams. Currently, some of the data is available on a site called pointstreak. The site hosts many junior, high school and college sports statistics. Teams all input stats live during games, typically done by a parent, player, or administrator (if in a more notable conference). The data is only available in team formats and lacks player info, key statistics, rosters, data export, or creative design. There are many missing statistics, and it lacks much flexibility in viewing the data. We aimed to build a preliminary pipeline and machine learning project to predict team winning percentage. Winning percentage is the number of wins a team wins the regular season divided by their total games played. In addition to traditional statistics like runs scored and hits, this paper will build other statistical measures of team performance. In the big picture, this is a proof of concept, and we hope to scale the data scraping and develop a front-end web application that houses these statistics for anyone to view.
